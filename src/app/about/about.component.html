            <h6>Hey hi! I am Sangesh.</h6>
            <p class="col-md-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6" style="height: 60%;">I am here to talk to you as your tea time buddy, about some life hacks, self-care tips and ideas to make
                you feel more content with your life.<br> <br>
                
            I am an emotional, happy-go-lucky person who loves animals, plants, observing human nature, listening to
                other’s stories and writing about ideas to make life better in my diary. One day I thought why not share
                them with others? And that’s how I decided to start this blog. <br> <br>
                
            Most of us are so caught up with day-to-day life, busy schedule, workload and home responsibilities that
                often we don’t realise how easy it can be to deal with issues that bother us. Making life less
                complicated and more amazing is not a tough task. It’s just </p> <div class="col-md-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6"> <img

                        style="width:100%; border-radius: 10px;"></div> 
             <P>that our minds are occupied with so many things that we overlook simple things, focus on bigger
                problems, overthink and end up getting overwhelmed. <br> <br>
             I am here to remind you of such easy breezy tips and tricks! <br> <br>
            Perhaps you might be knowing many of them already but while reading the posts here, who knows you will
                just end up figuring out what you needed to do. Perhaps you just needed someone to show you some ways to
                simplify life. Perhaps you just needed to talk about it over a cup of tea with a friend.
        <br> <br>
                So, let’s do it often!
